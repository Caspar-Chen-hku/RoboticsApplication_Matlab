# RoboticsApplication_Matlab
some simulations of robot arm movements accomplished in Matlab
- By making use of forward kinematics, we can know how the end point will move given the change of all the angles
- By making use of reverse kinematics, we can predict the arm movement given the change of end point
- The robot arm can also find the path by it self, by preventing itself from running into some obstacles
